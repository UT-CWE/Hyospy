**HyosPy**
=====
HyosPy (Hydrodynamic and oil spill Python) is a model coupling system developed by Dr. Ben R. Hodges' research team in CRWR at UT-Austin.
The old version is available at https://github.com/utcivil/HyosPy. 

The new version of HyosPy has the following new features:

1. The hydrodynamic model is switched from *SELFE* to *SUNTANS*.

2. The Texas Louisiana Shelf model *ROMS* is integrated in the system.

3. The two models are dynamically linked to provide a blended current product for oil spill modeling

4. A Probability map is added as another visualization tool.

Please refer to the user guide in /docs for the installation and manual of HyosPy.
