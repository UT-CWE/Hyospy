User manual for HyosPy
=====
# UT-Austin CWE

The use of HyosPy requires the user to create a new Python script for running simulations, in which all the parameters 
are defined. This run script allows the user to customize the simulation by specifying the parameters. This tutorial 
starts with creating the run script, [hyospy.py](https://github.com/UT-CWE/Hyospy/blob/Hyospy-develop/Hyospy_ensemble/hyospy.py)
